# AI Assignment 01 - Kids in the Yard
Comparison:

1. I used Anthropic Claude (claude.ai, Claude Sonnet 4.6).
2. I submitted the following prompt: Write an object-oriented Python program that simulates a family tree starting with two people born in 1950 and generates descendants until 2120. Each person should have: year born, year died (based on life expectancy ±10 years), first name, last name (with inheritance rules), optional partner (probability-based), and children (based on birth rate rules). Use three classes: Person, PersonFactory, and FamilyTree. The program should read required CSV files, generate the tree, and allow queries for total people, total by decade, and duplicate names. Follow PEP 8 style and explain your design decisions briefly.
3. The LLM-generated code and my original implementation follow similar structure and produce the same results, but they differ in organization. The LLM breaks larger methods into smaller helper functions, especially in PersonFactory.read_files() and FamilyTree.generate_tree(), which makes the code easier to read and less overwhelming. It also uses private attributes with underscores and accessor methods. In the Person class, the LLM adds a few extra methods like is_alive_in, __repr__, parent tracking, and a check to prevent duplicate children, making the design more extendable.
4. The biggest change I would make is breaking up generate_tree into smaller private helper methods like _maybe_assign_partner, _maybe_generate_children, _distribute_child_years, and _determine_child_last_name. My original version puts everything in one long method, which works, but it’s harder to read and follow. Splitting it up makes the logic clearer and easier to test.
5. I wouldn’t add _parents back-references or an add_parent method because the assignment never requires traversing from child to parent. Keeping bidirectional links adds extra complexity and creates more chances for inconsistencies if something goes wrong. I also wouldn’t add is_alive_in(year) since none of the required queries depend on checking whether someone is alive in a specific year, it feels unnecessary.
